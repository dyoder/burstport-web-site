                <p>Get to market quickly without sacrificing features or incurring technical
                    debt. We provide architecture and development consulting for building applications
                    and services using a proven, pre-integrated platform.</p>

                    <h2>Responsive and Extensible Apps</h2>
                    <p>Our Patchboard technology makes it easy to build sophiticated hypermedia
                        APIs, complete with client libraries that make them a snap to use. And
                        our worker-based architectural approach allows you to build highly responsive,
                        secure apps because you never have to re-establish connections between
                        clients and servers.</p>

                    <h2>Elastic, Cloud-Friendly Architecture</h2>
                    <p>With our highly efficient dispatchers and Redis-based messaging transport,
                        you can scale by simply adding workers where you have bottlenecks. Elasticity
                        can be achieved merely by monitoring task queues and allocating more workers.
                        And our cloud-based load testing tools make it easy to verify that your
                        app can handle load.</p>

                    <h2>Simple, Rapid Development</h2>
                    <p>We believe in keeping things simple wherever we can. We use CoffeeScript
                        for most custom development, which combines the familiarity of Javascript
                        with the expressiveness of Ruby, across both client and server. We use
                        node-fibers to manage the 'callback-spaghetti' often associated with Node-based
                        servers. We handle storage in MongoDB, which makes it easy to get up and
                        running quickly without sacrificing features (indexing, queries) or elasticity
                        (via clustering).</p>
